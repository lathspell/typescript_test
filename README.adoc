== Caveats for Java / Kotlin programmers

Values can not only be of one type but also of a set of types. I.e. something returned as "string | number" is either of those types.

Types are "structural types", not "nominal types", i.e. if an object has the properties "x" and "y", you can pass it to a function that expects a parameter of the "Point" interface type. If it also has a property "name", it additionally satisfies all interfaces that just require such an attribute.

Types also are not "reified", i.e. they lose all information about their type at runtime.
